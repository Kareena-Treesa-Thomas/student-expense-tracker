# Student-expense-tracker(Python Project)
A beginner-friendly Python CLI expense tracker designed to help students practice **core programming concepts** such as **lists, dictionaries, sets, recursion, and clean logic**.  
The project allows users to add expenses, view them, calculate total spending, and analyze spending by category — all through a simple command-line interface.

---

## Features
- Add expenses with **amount**, **category**, and optional **note**  
- View all recorded expenses in a structured list  
- Calculate **total spending** using recursion  
- Show **unique categories** using sets  
- Analyze spending per category and highlight the **highest spending category**  
- Simple and interactive **CLI interface**  

---

## How It Works?
1. User runs the Python program.  
2. The program displays a **menu** with  options: Add Expense, View Expenses, Total Spending, Category Analysis, and Exit.  
3. The user selects an option by typing the corresponding number.  
4. For “Add Expense,” the user enters amount, category, and optional note.  
5. For “View Expenses,” the program lists all added expenses.  
6. For “Total Spending,” the program calculates the total using **recursion**.  
7. For “Category Analysis,” the program shows spending per category and highlights the **highest spending category**.  
8. The user can exit the program anytime using the Exit option.

## Sample Output
```
=== Student Expense Tracker ===
1. Add Expense
2. View Expenses
3. Total Spending
4. Category Analysis
5. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter amount spent: 50
Enter category (food/travel/shopping/etc): food
Optional note: lunch
Expense added successfully!

Enter choice: 1
Enter amount spent: 200
Enter category (travel): bus
Expense added successfully!

Enter choice: 4
Unique Categories: {'travel', 'food'}
Spending per category:
food: 50.0
travel: 200.0
Highest spending category: travel (200.0)
```

## What I Learned

1. **Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples** – for efficiently storing, organizing, and managing expense data.

2. **Recursion** – used to calculate total spending in a clean and elegant way.

3. **CLI interface design** – creating a simple, intuitive menu-driven command-line interface.

4. **Project structuring for GitHub** – organizing files and README professionally for a mini-project.

5. **Data analysis in Python** – analyzing expenses and generating insights from basic data structures.


## Future Scope

1. **File persistence** – save expenses to a file so data isn’t lost when the program closes.

2. **Priority or recurring expenses** – add functionality to track important or repeated expenses.

3. **GUI version using Tkinter** – create a user-friendly graphical interface for the tracker.

4. **Weekly/Monthly reports** – generate automatic summaries for better expense management.

5. **Web or mobile expansion** – eventually build a full-stack version or mobile app for broader usage.
