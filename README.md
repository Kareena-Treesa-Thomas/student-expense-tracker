# Student-expense-tracker(Python Project)
A beginner-friendly Python CLI expense tracker designed to help students practice **core programming concepts** such as **lists, dictionaries, sets, recursion, and clean logic**.  
The project allows users to add expenses, view them, calculate total spending, and analyze spending by category — all through a simple command-line interface.

## Features
- Add expenses with **amount**, **category**, and optional **note**  
- View all recorded expenses in a structured list  
- Calculate **total spending** using recursion  
- Show **unique categories** using sets  
- Analyze spending per category and highlight the **highest spending category**  
- Simple and interactive **CLI interface**

## How It Works?
1. User runs the Python program.  
2. The program displays a **menu** with  options: Add Expense, View Expenses, Total Spending, Category Analysis, and Exit.  
3. The user selects an option by typing the corresponding number.  
4. For “Add Expense,” the user enters amount, category, and optional note.  
5. For “View Expenses,” the program lists all added expenses.  
6. For “Total Spending,” the program calculates the total using **recursion**.  
7. For “Category Analysis,” the program shows spending per category and highlights the **highest spending category**.  
8. The user can exit the program anytime using the Exit option.
