## 📌 Student-expense-tracker(Python Project)💰
A beginner-friendly Python CLI expense tracker designed to help students practice **core programming concepts** such as **lists, dictionaries, sets, recursion, functions and clean logic**.  
The project allows users to add expenses, view them, calculate total spending, and analyze spending by category — all through a simple command-line interface.

---

## 📍 Features✨
- Add expenses with **amount**, **category**, and optional **note**  
- View all recorded expenses in a structured list  
- Calculate **total spending** using recursion  
- Show **unique categories** using sets  
- Analyze spending per category and highlight the **highest spending category**  
- Simple and interactive **CLI interface**  

---

## 📍 How It Works?⚡
1. User runs the Python program. 🏃‍♂️    
2. The program displays a **menu** with  options: Add Expense, View Expenses, Total Spending, Category Analysis, and Exit.⌨️   
3. The user selects an option by typing the corresponding number.  
4. For “Add Expense,” the user enters amount, category, and optional note.💵    
5. For “View Expenses,” the program lists all added expenses. 👀    
6. For “Total Spending,” the program calculates the total using **recursion**.🔄  
7. For “Category Analysis,” the program shows spending per category and highlights the **highest spending category**.📈 
8. The user can exit the program anytime using the Exit option.❌

## 📍 What I Learned 💡

1. **Lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples** – for efficiently storing, organizing, and managing expense data.

2. **Functions** – breaking the program into reusable blocks such as adding expenses, viewing data, and analysis for better readability and maintainability.

3. **Recursion** – used to calculate total spending in a clean and elegant way.

4. **CLI interface design** – creating a simple, intuitive menu-driven command-line interface.

5. **Project structuring for GitHub** – organizing files and README professionally for a mini-project.

6. **Data analysis in Python** – analyzing expenses and generating insights using basic data structures.


## 📍 Future Scope🚀

1. **File persistence** – save expenses to a file so data isn’t lost when the program closes.

2. **Priority or recurring expenses** – add functionality to track important or repeated expenses.

3. **GUI version using Tkinter** – create a user-friendly graphical interface for the tracker.

4. **Weekly/Monthly reports** – generate automatic summaries for better expense management.

5. **Web or mobile expansion** – eventually build a full-stack version or mobile app for broader usage.
